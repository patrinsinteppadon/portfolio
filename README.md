# portfolio
Welcome to my personal website, which showcases my technical projects!
While the product is still under construction, this README will contain my
notes about site content

Link to Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/9mzJRGXIDeZFfta7FfY6sd/Patrin-Portfolio-Website?node-id=0%3A1

#### Things to add:
- Visual theme for the site (follow Wave's scheme for now)
- List of projects (maybe they'll be card format or something)
- Navbar?
- Home page with project list
- Short "About" section with an introduction
- Short "Skills" section where I go over the languages I know, probably in a stylized bullet list. I can also go over notable projects I've done with the language?
- Should I have a work experience section?
- Github Link to this site
- LinkedIn and email

#### List of projects
Each project should have a short blurb describing the project, my contribution to it, and the technologies used.
- Capstone project (Wave). Link the portfolio website and the github. Consider linking the demo youtube video, and the Figma designs
- Info 340 project (the asynchronous debate game). Link the website and the github from the info340 repository
- Ask the magic conch. Link the website link and Kiran's github repo
- TelEpi
- Grocery app from Info 448? LOL idk but its worth a try


#### CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
Setting up the formatting for each project card. I've got the img to render (I will need to figure out how to stop the img border from being longer than 100% width)

The text section of the card has been split into 2 columns (to follow card design #4 from the Figma). I think I got the Go to Website button working, but I'm struggling with the Github icon, because I'm implementing it as an img wrapped by an <a> tag. I think it'd be easiest and cleanest to make it an <i> component, and use font awesome for the img. We did this once in info 340 and I just need to remember how it worked.

I also need to add all the text that goes into the left side (title, co-author if relevant, and the body text).
